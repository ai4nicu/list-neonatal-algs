# Update a Markdown (.md) File on GitHub

*A beginner‑friendly, step‑by‑step guide. No prior Git/GitHub knowledge required.*

---

## Who is this for?
- Anyone who needs to make small updates (typos, new lines, lists, links, images) to a text file that ends with `.md` (Markdown) in a GitHub repository.
- You can do everything in your web browser—no installs needed.

---

## Quick summary (TL;DR)
1. Open the repository on GitHub → find the file (e.g., `README.md`).
2. Click **✏️ Edit** (pencil icon).
3. Make your text changes in the editor (use the **Preview** tab to check formatting).
4. Scroll down, write a short **commit message** (e.g., “Fix typos in README”).
5. Choose **Commit directly to the `main` branch** (if you have permission) **or** create a **new branch** and **Propose changes**.
6. If a **Pull Request** is created, click **Create pull request**, then someone with permission can **Merge** it.

## Part A — Editing directly on GitHub (best for simple changes)

### Step 1: Find the file
1. Go to the project URL on GitHub (something like `github.com/ai4nicu/list-neonatal-algs`).
2. In the file list, click on the Markdown file `README.md`.

### Step 2: Open the editor
1. Click the file name to view it.
2. Click the **✏️ Edit** button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
   - If you don’t see the pencil, you might not have permission to edit. In that case, click **Fork** (GitHub will copy the project to your account) and continue—your change will be suggested back to the original project.

### Step 3: Make your changes
1. You’ll see two tabs above the editor: **Edit file** and **Preview**.
2. Make edits under **Edit file**.
3. Click **Preview** to check how the Markdown will look.

### Step 4: Save your change with a commit
1. Scroll to **Commit changes**.
2. In **Commit message**, write a short description (imperative mood is common):
   - Examples: `Fix typo in section title`, `Add usage instructions`, `Update table links`.
3. Optionally add a longer **Description** line if needed.
4. Choose one of:
   - **Commit directly to the `main` branch** (only if you have write access), OR
   - **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request** (recommended if unsure).
5. Click **Commit changes**.

### Step 5 (if you created a branch): Open a Pull Request (PR)
1. After committing on a new branch, click **Create pull request**.
2. Review the title and description; add context if needed (what changed and why).
3. Click **Create pull request**.
4. A project maintainer can now review and **Merge** your changes. If you are the maintainer, you can merge it yourself when ready.

## Part B — Small Markdown how‑to 

> Markdown is a simple way to format text using plain characters.

### Headings
```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

### Bold and italic
```
**bold**  *italic*
```

### Lists
**Unordered (bullets):**
```
- first item
- second item
  - nested item
```
**Ordered (numbered):**
```
1. step one
2. step two
```

### Links
```
[Visible text](https://example.com)
```

### Images
```
![Alt text for screen readers](path/or/url/to/image.png)
```
- If the image is already in the repo, use its path (e.g., `images/plot.png`).
- If using a web image, paste the full URL. Make sure you have permission to use it.

### Code
**Inline code** uses backticks: \`like this\`.

**Code blocks** (for multiple lines):
````
```language
# example in bash/python/etc.
print("hello")
```
````

### Tables (simple)
```
| Column A | Column B |
|---|---|
| value 1 | value 2 |
| value 3 | value 4 |
```

### Line breaks
- End a line with **two spaces** to force a line break.
- Otherwise, leave a blank line between paragraphs.

---

## Part C — Good commit messages (1 sentence is fine)
- Use the present tense, like giving an instruction:
  - `Fix typo in installation section`
  - `Add troubleshooting note for Linux`
  - `Update link to dataset`
- Keep it short (50–72 characters if possible). Add details in the description box if needed.

---

## Part D — Common situations & fixes
- **“I don’t see the pencil icon.”**
  - You likely don’t have write access. Click **Fork** and GitHub will create your own copy. Make the edit there, then open a **Pull Request** to suggest your change.
- **“My list looks broken.”**
  - Make sure there’s a blank line before the list and consistent `-` or numbers. Indent nested items by two spaces.
- **“The table won’t render.”**
  - Ensure the separator row uses `|` pipes and `-` dashes like `|---|---|`. Keep column counts consistent on every row.
- **“The image doesn’t show.”**
  - Check that the path/URL is correct. For repo images, confirm the file exists in that folder on GitHub.
- **“The PR shows conflicts.”**
  - Someone changed the same file at the same time. Ask a maintainer to help resolve, or click **Resolve conflicts** if you know what to do.

## Part E — (Optional) Edit on your computer
If you prefer working locally, two beginner‑friendly options:

### Option 1: GitHub Desktop (no command line)
1. Install **GitHub Desktop** (Windows/macOS).
2. **Clone** the repository (File → Clone repository).
3. Open the `.md` file in a text editor (VS Code, Notepad, etc.).
4. Make changes; save the file.
5. In GitHub Desktop, write a **Summary** and **Commit to main** (or a branch).
6. Click **Push origin** to send your changes to GitHub.
7. Open a **Pull Request** if you used a branch.

### Option 2: Command line (for the curious)
```
# 1) Get the repo
git clone https://github.com/ai4nicu/list-neonatal-algs.git
cd REPO

# 2) Create a branch for your change (recommended)
git checkout -b docs/fix-typo

# 3) Edit the Markdown file in your editor, then save

# 4) Commit and push
git add path/to/file.md
git commit -m "Fix typos in documentation"
git push -u origin docs/fix-typo

# 5) Open a Pull Request on GitHub (the website will suggest this automatically)
```

## Glossary 
- **Repository (repo):** The project’s folder on GitHub that contains all files.
- **Branch:** A “copy” of the project where you can make changes safely.
- **Commit:** A saved checkpoint with a message describing the change.
- **Pull Request (PR):** A request to merge your changes into the main project after review.
- **Markdown (.md):** A simple formatting language for text (headings, lists, links, images).

---

## Quick checklist before you finish

- [ ] **Previewed** the Markdown in the **Preview** tab
- [ ] **Spelling & grammar** look good
- [ ] **Headings** are consistent (use `#`, `##`, `###` in order)
- [ ] **Links** work (clicked each)
- [ ] **Images** show up; have **alt text**; paths/URLs are correct
- [ ] **Lists** render correctly (blank line before list; indent nested items by two spaces)
- [ ] **Tables** have a separator row like `|---|---|` and consistent columns
- [ ] **Code blocks** use triple backticks and (optionally) a language label
- [ ] **Commit message** is short & imperative (e.g., “Fix typo in section 2”)
- [ ] Chose the right save option (**commit to main** if allowed, or **new branch + PR**)
- [ ] If a **PR**: clear title/description explain *what* and *why*
- [ ] Requested **reviewers**/assignees if your project uses them
- [ ] CI/checks are **green** (if the repo uses automated checks)
- [ ] No **merge conflicts**; or they’ve been resolved
- [ ] If the file feeds a site (e.g., **GitHub Pages**/docs), the page **renders correctly** after merge
- [ ] Updated any relevant **index/TOC** or cross‑links

Troubleshooting: if you need help from, include:
- The **link** to the file you tried to edit
- A **screenshot** (or copy/paste) of what looks wrong
- Your **commit link** or **Pull Request link**
